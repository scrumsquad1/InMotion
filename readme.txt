Vary rarely can we perform all our tasks at the same place. To the contrary, a daily to-do list will often have us running around a large area, checking off each item before we commute to the next. Naturally, this is not how we function. We naturally prefer to tackle tasks based off proximity, not priority. As such, having two to-do items on your calendar, one saying “pick up dry cleaning,” and the other saying “purchase more nails,” is worthless if these tasks are on entirely different sides of the city. We might accomplish one just to have the other roll over into the next day. If this is the case, why bother having them on a calendar? We tend to think more along the lines of “while I am in this area, I should do this.” Certainly, we should have a scheduling application that supports this.
